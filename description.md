This project has two goals:
- [X] Being a public repository for schema files that represent either not well-"known \[enough\] JSON\[, JavaScript, CSS, or YAML\] file formats" to be worthy of publication to [SchemaStore](https://www.schemastore.org)
- [ ] Generating and optionally publishing schemas from code representing existing data structures \(Java, JavaScript, TypeScript,  and C# are currently supported\)
- [ ] Allowing users several options for the value of their schema's **$id** property.   (https&ZeroWidthSpace;://language-name.schema.place/...) or any valid URI fragment which is either in the public domain or to which the user owns the intellectual property rights are curently supported.
