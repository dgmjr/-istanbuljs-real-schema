# schema.place

## Project goals

1 [#] ### Being a public repository for not-very-well-known-enough data formats to be worthy of publication at schemastore.org.  Alternatively, you might want to use a data structure and writing your code would be made much easier if you had such a tool \(but there are already plenty projects for generating one-off schemas from data structures\).
2 [ ] ### Generating and optionally serving as the host for that not-very-well-known schema or unduly neglected data structure.

We are happy to report that goal \#1 is complete.  Head on over [here](goal2.htm) for our explanation of what we have planned for goal \#2.
