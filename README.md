# -istanbuljs-real-schema
The @istanbuljs/schema project contains JavaScript definitions only, which are not useful when composing configuration files in JSON or YAML.  This very lightweight project generates JSON and YAML schemas for Istanbul's and nyc configuration files, which can be used by the IDE to validate the configuration as well as provide code completion hints.
