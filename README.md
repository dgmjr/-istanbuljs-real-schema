# @istanbuljs/real-schema
## Real/Usable JSON and YAML Schemas for nyc and istanbuljs
The [@istanbuljs/schema](https://github.com/istanbuljs/schema) project contains JavaScript definitions only, which are not useful when composing configuration files in JSON or YAML.  This very lightweight project simply generates JSON and YAML schemas for .nycrc(.json/.yaml/.yml) configuration files, which can be used by the IDE to validate the configuration as well as provide code completion hints.
